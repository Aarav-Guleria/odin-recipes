# odin-recipes

A simple HTML project built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course
It includes a basic website with links to different recipes using only HTML.

## What I Learned

- Basic structure of an HTML document
- Using semantic tags like <head>, <body>, <a>, <img>, <ul>, etc.
- Creating links between pages relative and absolute
- Organizing a project with multiple HTML files
